# Object-oriented programming in JavaScript

### What is an object and how do I create it?
- __Array__ `[ ]`: ordered collection of elements, referenced by indexes
- __Object__ `{ }`: unordered collection of key/value pairs, referenced explicitly
    - Accessing an object's properties is _not entirely the same as in Python,_ as keys in Javascript don't need to be hashable (strings, numbers, floats). You access them either by
        - dot notation: `object.key`, or
        - bracket notation: `object['key']`
    - Both can be extended for nested objects.

##### Creating objects
    const myobject = { }; // or
    const myObject = new Object();

##### Adding or changing properties
Simply specify property name and give it a value. _We can also add methods (i.e. functions) to objects!_

##### Removing properties
    `delete object['key'];` 
    // or
    `delete object.key;`

Primitives (string, number, boolean, float) are immutable, meaning they only change inside a function. Objects are reference-based and thus are mutable, meaning values change both inside and outside a function. Changes in a copy will thus also change the original. Thus, when comparing (===) objects, what matters is the reference.

##### Calling methods
    `object['method']();` 
    // or
    `object.method();`

##### Returning keys and values in an array
    `Object.keys(objectName);` 
    // and
    `Object.values(objectName);`
- If desired, an argument can be passed inside the brackets. 

### The 'this' keyword
We use `this` to refer to the object at hand.
How a function is invoked determines the value of `this` inside the function.
- When invoked from a constructor function, the value of `this` is the newly created object (see _'Constructor functions'_).
- When invoked as a method, the value of `this`is whatever is left of the dot at invocation (i.e. the object).
- When invoked as a regular function, the value of `this` is the global `window` object.
    - Every `var` (__not__ `let` and `const`!) declaration made at the global level, i.e. outside of a function, becomes a property on the `window` object.
    - Likewise, every global function declaration becomes a method on the `window` object.
        - Global variables and functions are not ideal (tight coupling, name collisions), so only write them as a last resort!

### Functions at runtime

JavaScript functions are _first-class objects_, and can be ...
- stored in a variable,
- passed in as an argument in another function (we call the passed-in argument the _callback function_),[*] and
- returned from another function (the so-called _higher-order function_)
    - It can be called using double parentheses.

[*] Example array methods:
1. `forEach()` takes in a callback function and invokes that functoin for each element in the array,
    `array.forEach(callbackFunc);`

2. `map()` does the same, but returns a new array based on what's returned from the callback function, and
    ```    
    array.map(function(arrayitem) {
        return arrayitem.length;
    });
    ```
3. `filter()` does the same as `map()`, but is used as a test: only the items that pass are included in the new array.
    ```
    array.filter(function(arrayitem) {
        return arrayitem.length < 6;
    });
    ```
___
    
__Note:__ Functions can be invoked by (), objects can __NOT__.

Besides global scope and function scope, there is _runtime scope_. This is the context of the function, i.e. the set of variables available for the function to use.
A function has acces to: _function's arguments, local variables, variables from parent function scope, and global variables._

    const a = 'a'; // global variable
    function parent() {
        const b = 'b'; // variable from parent scope
        function child() {
            const c = 'c'; // local variable within function
        }
    };

CHILD > PARENT > GLOBAL _SCOPE CHAIN_: start sequence thoughts from innermost function and work outwards from there, building what innermost needs all the way to global window.

Functions will retain the scope chain plus access even if they're invoked somewhere else than where it was declared.

__Note:___ if two variables have the same name, the one that is found 'first' by the JavaScript engine prevails (_variable shadowing_).

### Closure
The process of a function retaining access to its scope. Every function has closure.

### Immediately-Invoked Function Expressions (IIFEs)
Functions that are called immeciately after they're defined.

Type | Code
--- | ---
Declaration | `function logger() {console.log('Hello!')};`
Expression | `(function logger() {console.log('Hello!')});`
IIFE | `(function logger(x) {console.log('Hello!')})();`

IIFEs can also wrap around nested functions. They create a private scope that protects variables and methods from being used, because the function is called immediately and thus variables are called immediately. This prevents from unwanted mutations or side-effects because of external access. The returned functions are still publicly accessible, but the variables defined within them are not.

### Classes
Classes are categories of objects.
- __Object__: properties and methods
- __Class__: blueprint for an object

##### Constructor functions
Start with a capital letter; Must be called with `new`; Has object created automatically


    new SoftwareDev() {
        this.favLang = 'JS'; // this refers to SoftwareDev
    }; // no return statement!


From here, you can create a new object (_an instance_) - as many as you like.


    let developer = new SoftwareDeveloper();


__Constructor functions accept arguments!__ We could update the previous as follows:


    function SoftwareDeveloper (name) {
        this.favLang = 'JS';
        this.name = name;
        this.introduce = function() {
            console.log(`I'm ${this.name}!`);
        }
    };


To instantiate a new object from here:

```
    let myself = new SoftwareDeveloper('Diana');
```
If we would then invoke `myself.name`, it would yield Diana.

__So:__
Define:


    new FuncName();


Add properties:


    function FuncName(arg1, arg2) {
        this.arg1 = arg1;
        this.arg2 = arg2;
        this.prop3 = x;
        this.prop4 = function() {
            console.log(`Hello ${arg2}!`);
        };
    };


Assign to variable to instantiate new object __or__ start with 2. and then add:


    const objName = new FuncName(arg1, arg2);


To check if objName was created with FuncName: `objName instanceof FuncName`.

### Setting the value of `this` ourselves
1. `call()`
2. `apply()`
3. `bind()`

### Prototypal inheritance
We can add methods to the constructor function's __prototype__ property. The prototype property is an object. All objects created by that construcor are linked to this prototype object.


    Object.prototype.method = function() {
        if (this.canTalk) {
            console.log('Hi, I am ' + this.name);
        }
    };

##### Prototype chain
* Objects own properties and methods ˅
* Constructor prototype ˅
* Object() object (top level parent) ˅
* Still not found? `Undefined`

##### Check where property comes from
1. `hasOwnProperty();`
2. `isPrototypeOf();`
3. `Object.getPrototypeOf();`

Every time an object is created, a special property is assigned to it under the hood: constructor. It returns a reference to the constructor function that created that object (`object.constructor`).

##### Subclasses
To set up the prototype of an object ourselves, we use `Object.create()`. This is a clean method to establish prototypal inheritance.
